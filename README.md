This repository contains information and examples for implementing general-game-playing AIs
in C++, with a Java wrapper around them, such that they can subsequently be used
in the Java-based Ludii General Game System.

- For general information on implementing AIs for Ludii (not in C++), see: https://github.com/Ludeme/LudiiExampleAI
- For general tutorials about Ludii, see: https://ludiitutorials.readthedocs.io

## Requirements

- Java version 8 or higher (including JDK)
- TODO JNI / C++ requirements
- Version 1.3.9 or later of [Ludii](https://ludii.games/download.php)

## Getting Started

TODO

## Generating Headers for Native Code

For this example, the header files for native code were automatically generated by running the following
command (which, at the same time, also compiles our Java code). This is run from the root directory of
the project, and assumes that Ludii's main `jar` file has been put in the `/libs` directory. It puts the
compiled Java class files in `/bin`, and the headers for native code in `/native/src`:

```
javac -cp ./libs/*.jar -d ./bin ./src/ludii_cpp_ai/LudiiCppAI.java -h ./native/src
```

## Compiling the C++ Code

We run the following command to compile the C++ code, and put the compiled object in `/native/bin`:

**Linux:**
```
g++ -c -fPIC -I${JAVA_HOME}/include -I${JAVA_HOME}/include/linux ./native/src/ludii_cpp_ai_LudiiCppAI.cpp -o ./native/bin/ludii_cpp_ai_LudiiCppAI.o
```

**Windows:**
```
g++ -c -I"%JAVA_HOME%\include" -I"%JAVA_HOME%\include\win32" ./native/src/ludii_cpp_ai_LudiiCppAI.cpp -o ./native/bin/ludii_cpp_ai_LudiiCppAI.o
```

**MacOS (not tested!):**
```
g++ -c -fPIC -I${JAVA_HOME}/include -I${JAVA_HOME}/include/darwin ./native/src/ludii_cpp_ai_LudiiCppAI.cpp -o ./native/bin/ludii_cpp_ai_LudiiCppAI.o
```

## Building the Shared Library

We run the following command to build a shared library with native code that can be loaded from Java,
and put it in `/libs` (alongside Ludii's `jar` file):

**Linux:**
```
g++ -shared -fPIC -o ./libs/libLudiiCppAI.so ./native/bin/ludii_cpp_ai_LudiiCppAI.o -lc
```

**Windows:**
```
g++ -shared -o ./libs/LudiiCppAI.dll ./native/bin/ludii_cpp_ai_LudiiCppAI.o -Wl,--add-stdcall-alias
```

**MacOS (not tested!):**
```
g++ -dynamiclib -o ./libs/libLudiiCppAI.dylib ./native/bin/ludii_cpp_ai_LudiiCppAI.o -lc
```

## Citing Information

When using Ludii in any publications (for example for running experiments, or
for visual inspections of your agent's behaviour during development, etc.), 
please cite [our paper on the Ludii system](http://ecai2020.eu/papers/1248_paper.pdf).
This can be done using the following BibTeX entry:

## Background Info

This repository contains information and examples for the development of C++-based
AI implementations, with a Java wrapper such that they can subsequently be loaded
into the Java-based Ludii General Game System.

This work, as well as the full Ludii system itself, are developed for the
Digital Ludeme Project. More info on the project and the system can be found on:

- http://www.ludeme.eu/
- http://ludii.games/

The preferred method for getting help with troubleshooting, suggesting or
requesting additional is [creating new Issues on the github repository](https://github.com/Ludeme/Ludii_AI_Cpp/issues).
